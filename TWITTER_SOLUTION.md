# Twitter Video Upload - Alternative Solution

## ⚠️ Important Note

The demo video file (`monadswarm-demo.webp`) is in WebP format, which is an animated image format that Twitter doesn't accept for video uploads.

## ✅ Best Solution: Use YouTube Instead

Since converting the WebP to a proper video format is complex, here's the fastest approach:

### Option 1: YouTube + Twitter (RECOMMENDED - 5 min)

**Step 1: Upload to YouTube** (3 min)
1. Go to https://youtube.com/upload (already opened earlier)
2. Upload `monadswarm-demo.webp`
3. Set to "Unlisted"
4. Get YouTube link

**Step 2: Post Tweet with YouTube Link** (2 min)
```

3. **Save as MP4**
4. **Upload to Twitter** with your tweet

## 🎯 My Recommendation

**Use YouTube!** It's:
- ✅ Faster (no conversion needed)
- ✅ More reliable (YouTube accepts WebP)
- ✅ Professional (judges can watch in HD)
- ✅ Meets hackathon requirements

The hackathon form accepts YouTube links, and you can still share the YouTube link in your tweet!

## 📋 Quick Action Plan

1. Upload video to YouTube (3 min)
2. Post tweet with YouTube link (2 min)
3. Submit form with both links (1 min)

**Total: 6 minutes to complete submission!**
