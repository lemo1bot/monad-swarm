# Twitter Video Upload Guide

## 🐦 Posting Demo Video on Twitter

### Option 1: Video + Tweet Combined (RECOMMENDED)

**This is perfect because:**
- You post the video WITH your announcement tweet
- One tweet serves both purposes (announcement + demo)
- You get one URL for both requirements

**Steps:**

1. **Go to Twitter**
   ```
   https://twitter.com/compose/tweet
   ```

2. **Attach the video**
   - Click the image/video icon (📷)
   - Navigate to: `/Users/foriadahemed/Downloads/monad-swarm/`
   - Select: `monadswarm-demo.webp`
   - Wait for upload (should be quick, file is only 11KB)

3. **Add your tweet text**
   ```

4. **Post the tweet**
   - Click "Post"

5. **Get the URL**
   - Click on your tweet to open it
   - Copy the URL from browser address bar
   - Example: `https://twitter.com/YourUsername/status/1234567890`

6. **Use in Moltiverse form**
   - Paste this URL in BOTH fields:
     - "Tweet Link" field
     - "2-Min Demo Video Link" field
   - (Same URL works for both since video is in the tweet!)

## ⚡ Why This is Perfect

- ✅ One tweet = announcement + demo video
- ✅ One URL for both form requirements
- ✅ More engagement on Twitter
- ✅ Faster than uploading to YouTube

## ⚠️ Note

Twitter video limit is 2 minutes 20 seconds for non-premium users, and your video is under 2 minutes, so you're good!

If Twitter doesn't accept the .webp format, you can:
1. Convert to MP4 first (I can help with this)
2. Or use YouTube instead

But try Twitter first - it should work!
