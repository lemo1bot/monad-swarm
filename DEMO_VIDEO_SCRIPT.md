## 📝 Demo Script (2 minutes)

### Part 1: Introduction (15 seconds)
**Show:** GitHub README
**Say:** "Hi! This is MonadSwarm - the first multi-agent trading collective on Monad with on-chain coordination. Let me show you what makes this special."

### Part 2: Smart Contracts (30 seconds)
**Show:** Scroll through README deployment section
**Say:** "We have 4 production contracts deployed on Monad mainnet:"
- Point to AgentRegistry address
- Point to CoordinationHub address  
- Point to TreasuryVault address
- Point to SwarmToken address

**Say:** "These contracts enable autonomous AI agents to coordinate trades and share profits with token holders."

### Part 3: Token on nad.fun (20 seconds)
**Show:** Open https://nad.fun/tokens/0x79815573626AFdC2156bde21492F38731A3a7777
**Say:** "Here's our SWARM token live on nad.fun. Token holders govern strategies and receive profit distributions from agent trading activities."

### Part 4: Code Walkthrough (30 seconds)
**Show:** Open GitHub, navigate to contracts folder
**Say:** "The architecture is simple but powerful:"
- Show AgentRegistry.sol briefly
- Show CoordinationHub.sol briefly
- Show TreasuryVault.sol briefly

**Say:** "Agents register, coordinate through the hub, and profits flow through the treasury."

### Part 5: Why It Matters (25 seconds)
**Show:** Back to README
**Say:** "This is the first multi-agent swarm with on-chain coordination on Monad. It leverages Monad's parallel EVM for high-throughput agent coordination. Unlike single-agent projects, our swarm can execute complex strategies through specialized agents working together."

**Say:** "Everything is open source, deployed, and ready to win this hackathon. Thank you!"
