# Alternative Solution - Skip the Demo Video

## ⚠️ Issue with Current Video

The generated file is a WebP animated image, not a proper video format. While we converted it to MP4, it only contains a single frame.

## ✅ FASTEST SOLUTION (2 minutes)

Since the demo video is **optional** in many hackathons, let's check if you can submit without it:

### Option 1: Submit Without Video (FASTEST - 2 min)
